## 🎯 **Best Practices from Case Studies**

### **1. Start with AI Integration**
```bash
# Most successful implementations begin with AI
cip init --type auto-detect --ai-provider ollama
```

### **2. Iterate on Validation Questions**
```yaml
# Custom validation questions improve comprehension
validation_questions:
  - "What is the primary purpose of the /experiments directory?"
  - "How do the theory files relate to the experimental data?"
  - "What validation steps should be followed before publishing?"
```

### **3. Use Templates for Consistency**
```bash
# Teams benefit from standardized templates
cip init --template-dir ./team-templates --type sdk
```

### **4. Automate Maintenance**
```bash
# Regular updates maintain quality
./scripts/maintenance/update-metadata.sh ./workspace
```
