# ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations and Constraints

## ü§ñ AI Integration Limitations

### Ollama Local Integration

**Current Constraints:**
- Requires Ollama running locally on port 11434
- Model quality varies significantly (CodeLlama vs Llama3.2)
- No automatic model fallback if preferred model unavailable
- Description generation can be verbose or inconsistent

**Performance Issues:**
- Cold start: 10-15 seconds for first request
- Large directories: May timeout on complex analysis
- Memory usage: 2-4GB RAM for larger models

**Workarounds:**
```bash
# Test connectivity before batch processing
cip ai-enhance --test-only

# Use smaller, faster models for batch operations
cip ai-metadata --model codellama:7b

# Fallback to rule-based generation
cip generate-metadata --force
```

### VM Service Integration

**Current Status:** üöß **Design Phase** - Not yet implemented

**Planned Limitations:**
- Requires cloud infrastructure setup
- Network dependency for all AI operations
- Potential latency for real-time operations
- Cost considerations for large-scale processing

## üìä Validation System Limitations

### Cross-Repository Validation

**Current Issues:**
- Assumes all repositories in same parent directory
- No remote repository validation (GitHub, etc.)
- Limited to `repo://` URL scheme validation
- No circular dependency detection

**Missing Features:**
- Repository versioning compatibility checks
- Dynamic dependency resolution
- Network-based repository discovery

### Compliance Scoring

**Scoring Limitations:**
- Binary pass/fail for most checks
- No weighted importance scoring
- Fixed 80% compliance threshold
- Limited customization of rule priorities

**Improvement Areas:**
- Configurable scoring weights
- Progressive compliance levels
- Context-aware validation rules
- Project-type specific requirements

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Limitations

### Schema Evolution

**Current Constraints:**
- Manual schema migration required
- No automatic upgrade path from v1.0 to v2.0
- Limited backward compatibility checking
- Breaking changes require manual intervention

**Migration Challenges:**
- Large repositories require full regeneration
- Custom metadata may be lost during upgrades
- No rollback mechanism for failed migrations

### File System Dependencies

**Platform Issues:**
- Windows path handling inconsistencies
- Case-sensitive vs case-insensitive file systems
- Unicode filename support variations
- Symlink handling differences across platforms

**Performance Constraints:**
- Large directory trees (>1000 dirs) slow processing
- No incremental processing for partial updates
- Memory usage scales with repository size
- No caching mechanism for repeated operations

## üîß CLI Tool Limitations

### User Experience

**Current Issues:**
- Limited progress indicators for long operations
- No interactive configuration wizard
- Minimal error recovery options
- No undo/rollback functionality

**Missing Features:**
- Configuration file templates
- Project-specific presets
- Batch operation scheduling
- Integration with IDEs/editors

### Error Handling

**Robustness Issues:**
- Network failures cause complete operation failure
- Partial failures leave repository in inconsistent state
- Limited error context for debugging
- No automatic retry mechanisms

## üåê Ecosystem Integration

### Repository Discovery

**Current Limitations:**
- Manual ecosystem root configuration required
- No automatic repository discovery
- Limited to local file system repositories
- No Git integration for remote repositories

**Scaling Issues:**
- Performance degrades with large ecosystems
- No distributed ecosystem support
- Manual link validation only
- No automated dependency tracking

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

**Testing Gaps:**
- Primary development on Windows
- Limited testing on Linux/macOS
- Docker container support not implemented
- CI/CD pipeline integration incomplete

## üêõ Known Bugs

### High Priority

- **Windows Path Handling**: Inconsistent behavior with spaces in paths
- **Ollama Connection**: No graceful handling of connection refused
- **Memory Leaks**: Large repository processing shows memory growth

### Medium Priority

- **YAML Formatting**: Generated files sometimes have inconsistent indentation
- **Unicode Support**: Non-ASCII characters in directory names cause issues
- **Progress Reporting**: Long operations appear to hang without feedback

### Low Priority

- **Help Text**: Some CLI commands missing detailed help
- **Log Output**: Debug information too verbose for normal users
- **Color Support**: Terminal color detection inconsistent
