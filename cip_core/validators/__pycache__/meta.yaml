description: The directory structure __pycache__ is a cache of Python files that have
  been compiled and stored for faster execution. It typically contains files with
  extensions .cpython-311.pyc, which are bytecode files generated by the Python interpreter
  when a Python file is compiled. This directory is usually found in the same location
  as the original Python file, but with a different name, such as 'cip_core\validators'.
