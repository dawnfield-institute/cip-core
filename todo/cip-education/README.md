# CIP Education Core Platform

**Status:** Design Phase  
**Phase:** Planning and Specification  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Timeline:** Q4 2025 - Q4 2026  

## Overview

The CIP Education Core platform represents a revolutionary approach to personalized learning through modular, AI-driven educational technology. This directory contains comprehensive design documents for a system that packages knowledge into pip-installable modules with agent-agnostic protocols.

## Core Innovation

Unlike traditional educational platforms that focus on behavioral frameworks, CIP Education Core emphasizes:

- **Protocol-First Design**: Agent-agnostic specifications that work with any AI tutor
- **Knowledge Modularity**: Pip-installable educational packages with clear dependencies
- **Evidence-Based Learning**: Assessment through demonstration rather than testing
- **Adaptive Pathways**: Dynamic curriculum adjustment based on learning analytics
