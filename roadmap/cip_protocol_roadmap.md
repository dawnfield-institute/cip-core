# CIP Protocol Roadmap

This roadmap details the ongoing development and extension of the Cognition Index Protocol (CIP) for semantic tagging, permissions, and agentic navigation.

---

## New Project Integration (2025)

### **Active CIP Implementation Projects**
The CIP protocol is now being implemented across multiple scaffolded projects:

- **MCP Server**: CIP knowledge testing API with adaptive difficulty assessment ([Architecture](../devkit/projects/mcp_server/docs/architecture/))
- **Brainstem**: CIP-MCP bridge for cognitive repository navigation ([Design](../devkit/projects/brainstem/))
- **Aletheia**: CIP-integrated knowledge verification and truth pricing ([Framework](../devkit/projects/aletheia/))
- **Kronos**: CIP compliance for FDO document temporal indexing ([Roadmap](kronos_roadmap.md))

### **CIP Integration Status**
- âœ… **MCP Server**: Complete API design for CIP testing and validation
- âœ… **Brainstem**: CIP navigation interface with fractal visualization
- âœ… **Aletheia**: CIP protocol compliance for knowledge market operations
- ðŸ”„ **Implementation Phase**: Transitioning from design to practical deployment

---

## Milestones
- âœ… Extend CIP schema for contextual permissions and routing
- ðŸ”„ Integrate audit and movement logging (MCP Server implementation)
- ðŸ”„ Automate publishing checks and compliance validation (Multiple projects)
- ðŸ”„ Modularize instructions and metadata interpretation (Brainstem integration)
- ðŸŽ¯ Launch CIP sample repository and validator scripts

---

## Current Priorities
- ðŸ”„ **Implementation Integration**: Deploy CIP across MCP Server, Brainstem, and Aletheia
- ðŸ”„ **Knowledge Testing**: Complete MCP Server CIP testing API with adaptive evaluation
- ðŸ”„ **Navigation Interface**: Finalize Brainstem CIP-MCP bridge functionality
- ðŸ”„ **Compliance Validation**: Automate CIP compliance checking across all projects
- ðŸŽ¯ **Schema Standardization**: Finalize CIP schema update and config files

---

## Next Steps
- **Phase 1**: Complete MCP Server CIP knowledge testing implementation
- **Phase 2**: Deploy Brainstem CIP navigation interface
- **Phase 3**: Integrate Aletheia knowledge verification with CIP compliance
- **Phase 4**: Launch public CIP protocol template repository with real implementations
- **Phase 5**: Document and validate all CIP contexts, roles, and permissions across projects
